SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_stat_activity : to get the connection details of PG
dumping the database: pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -p 5432 test > testing_db.sql
Writing the dump back to database: psql -h localhost -U postgres test < testing_db.sql: Ensure you have mentioned the DB name
select min_val, max_val from pg_settings where name='max_connections';
SHOW config_file;
There can empty spaces and 'null' mentioned cells. The later can be handled by converting them to empty spaces
There are DELIMITER E'delimiter' option for using \t with CSV, but reading the documentation informed that is wrong way of doing it. Need to use the Text mode
COPY hr_table(employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, hire_dt, job_id, salary, commission, manager_id, department_id) FROM 'hr_employees.csv' WITH (FORMAT TEXT);
Entity relation diagram can be taken from dbeaver application, using the view ER diagram is clicked. The diagram can be saved and opened in any of the draw_io tools
Below copy command needs to be executed from the database prompt only
\copy music_analysis from music.csv header csv delimiter ',';

Steps to understand Data:

- First create the tables of the data inside the database manually, and load it inside the database.
- Understand whether the table is transactional or Non-transactional. 
- Next try to establish the connectivity between each of the tables. 
- Create the Entity Relationship diagram of the tables for better view of the entire table.
- Based on the ER diagram, check if there are tables that have hierarchical Relationship
The scripts are executed at database prompt maintenance=# \i /run/media/solverbot/repoA/gitFolders/data-engineering-spark/data/retail_db/load_db_tables_pg.sql 
postgres service :sudo systemctl status postgresql
sudo -u postgres -i to enter the postgres user setting
/usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgres/data -l logfile start
once you set up new pgserver, connect to a database and then you can set password, like \c postgres and then \password
In order to allow connection the postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf file inside the /postgres/data needs to modified
The key to connecting with postgres, setting up tunnel so the network can see the port
to connect to psql -h 192.168.13.229 -U postgres -p 5432
Tunnel config for postgres: ssh -L 5433:localhost:5432 kali@192.168.13.229
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres test > test_database.sql
to write data back in database psql -d theroodb -f throoedb.sql
if there is datestyle error then use SET DateStyle TO European;
The database has to be designed at physical, logical and view level
The datamodels are relational, Entity-Relational, Object-based, Semistructructed data models. Object Relational data model is also persent
storage manager stores, retrieves and updates data
Atomicity is all or none, to maintain consistency and durable. The issue has to be isolated transaction
Data definition or schema is stored in data dictionary
Data model is conceptual tool to describe Data + relationship + semantics + Constraints
row is dbms is tuple and a column is the attribute
When a domain is said to atomic, it is indivisible in nature. That is, it cannot be divided into subparts. The Dates, Phonenumbers, registration numbers etc can be considered indivisible and divisble at the same time.
To access the data, table name, primary key and column name is used
Super key and Candidate key, which is minimal key out of all super keys, primary key is unique key without null values
in procedural QL the data needed and how it has to be retrived is mentioned. But in Non Procedural, the procedure is not mentioned
adding unique to column makes it alternate key

su - postgres -c '/usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /var/lib/postgresql/data'
cp -r /var/lib/postgresql/data /dev/shm
su - postgres -c '/usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin/pg_ctl -D /dev/shm start'

Add the following in the pg_hba.conf file when required
