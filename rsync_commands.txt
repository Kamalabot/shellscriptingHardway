for a single file >> rsync -zvh backup.tar.gz /tmp/backups/

for a folder >> rsync -azvh /run/media/solverbot/repoA/gitFolders/shellscriptingHardway/ /run/media/solverbot/repoB/tempShell/

for remote synching >>  rsync -azvh /run/media/solverbot/repoA/gitFolders/botoPersonal/ kali@192.168.64.229:/home/kali/sync_dir

With rsync, we can use SSH (Secure Shell) for data transfer, using SSH protocol while transferring our data you can be ensured that your data is being transferred in a secured connection with encryption so that nobody can read your data while it is being transferred over the wire on the internet.

rsync -azvhe ssh /run/media/solverbot/repoA/gitFolders/shellscriptingHardway/ kali@192.168.64.229:/home/kali/enc_dir

When syncing remote directories directories use the -a and -e flag. 

When syncing directories with the -a no need to include the final '/' that will create 
a new directory in the remote
The below command provides the progress
rsync -azvh --progress /run/media/solverbot/repoC/Programming_Course_Vids /run/media/solverbot/repoE/

selective foldes can be synced by 

rsync -azvh --progress --include 'r*' /run/media/solverbot/repoC/Programming_Course_Vids /run/media/solverbot/repoE/

rsync -azvh --progress --exclude 't*' /run/media/solverbot/repoC/Programming_Course_Vids /run/media/solverbot/repoE/
